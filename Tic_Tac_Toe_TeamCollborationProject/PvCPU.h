/*
Public interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe CPU opponent.

Board encoding:
- Empty cells are numeric strings ("1".."9" or "1".."16").
- Occupied cells are exactly "X" or "O" (uppercase).

Difficulty behavior (summary):
- Easy   : mostly random; occasionally takes an obvious win/block.
- Medium : rules first (win/block/center/corners), then a simple heuristic.
- Hard   : alphaâ€“beta search (perfect on 3x3, depth-capped on 4x4).

Return contract:
- Returns a 0-based index into `board` where the CPU should play.
- Returns -1 if the game is already over (win/draw) or no legal moves exist.
